# SwiftPy Docs

A simple python-like programming language to get introduced to programming.

## Usage

To run a SwiftPy file, use the following command:

```

python spyt.py filename.spyt

```

## Functionality

### Lexer

The `Lexer` class is responsible for tokenizing the source code. It breaks down the code into meaningful components called tokens, which are then used by the parser. The lexer recognizes various types of tokens such as:
- Numbers
- Identifiers
- Operators
- String literals
- Parentheses
- Braces
- Commas
- Newlines
- Spaces

### Parser

The `Parser` class processes the tokens generated by the lexer and creates an abstract syntax tree (AST). The parser identifies functions and statements in the code, checks for correct syntax, and ensures that parentheses are properly matched. The AST is a structured representation of the source code that is used for code generation.

### Code Generator

The `CodeGenerator` class takes the AST produced by the parser and generates equivalent Python code. It translates SwiftPy constructs into Python functions and statements, ensuring that the generated code is syntactically correct and ready to be executed by a Python interpreter.

## Compilation

The main script compiles the SwiftPy code to Python code. It uses the `Lexer` to tokenize the input code, the `Parser` to create the AST, and the `CodeGenerator` to produce the final Python code. If any syntax errors or mismatched parentheses are detected during parsing, appropriate error messages are displayed.

```

lexer = Lexer(smp_code)
tokens = lexer.tokenize()

try:
    parser = Parser(tokens)
    ast = parser.parse()

    code_generator = CodeGenerator(ast)
    python_code = code_generator.generate_code().strip()

    print(python_code)
except (SyntaxError, IndexError) as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```
